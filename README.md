# In silico Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction system regime cartography code

## Code overview
The driver script is "BZRegimeCartographyMain.m". All parameters for the framework are initialize in the driver script, and through the driver script Matlab will execute the regime cartography framework. The custom functions are stored in the 'code/BZRegimeCartographySubFun' folder, which will be called by the driver script to execute specific processes. The sequences of the framework, and the purpose of each custom function are described in their respective Matlab script. The code takes about 5 hours to run.

Regime plots generated by the codes are not labelled with numbers, and the colors represents the following regimes:

Regime 1 - Green\
Regime 2 - Blue\
Regime 3 - Magenta\
Regime 4 - Yellow\
Regime 5 - Sky Blue\
Regime 6 - Red


## Note on code reproducibility through Code Ocean's reproducible run
The original code was executed using Matlab 2023b on a laptop with Windows 11 Home, a 12th Gen Intel Core i7-12700H (2.30 GHz) CPU, and 32GB of RAM.

When the code was migrated to the Code Ocean environment, minor differences in results arose from some of Matlab's inbuilt functions (like 'ode'). These differences causes differences in the trained neural network ensemble, hence the result generated from the Code Ocean platform will be slightly different from those published in the paper.For reference, the results presented in the manuscript are stored in 'data/Main manuscript result'.
